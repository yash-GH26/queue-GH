# Queue Implementation using Linked List in C

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Queue** data structure implemented in C using **Linked Lists** instead of arrays.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Dynamic memory allocation (no fixed size)
- Enqueue (Insert)
- Dequeue (Delete)
- Display
- Handles Underflow condition

---

## 🧠 How It Works
A **queue** is a **FIFO (First In First Out)** structure.
- Elements are inserted at the **rear**.
- Elements are deleted from the **front**.
- Here, linked lists make the queue flexible and memory-efficient.

## 🖥️ Usage
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc queue.c -o queue
